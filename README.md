# Genesis AI

**Current Status: "Baby" Stage**

Genesis is a powerful, modular, and locally-hosted AI Agent platform. It features a robust plugin system, autonomous action execution, and a sleek web interface.

> **Note**: This entire system was built in just **3 days** using **Antigravity**.

## Vision & Growth

We are currently in the "Baby" stage of development, but the potential is limitless. We are actively looking for contributors, visionaries, and supporters to help **grow this system** and push it out to the world.

If you believe in local, private, and powerful AI, join us in making Genesis a standard for personal AI agents.

## Quick Install

1. **Install Python 3.10+**
2. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run**:

    ```bash
    ./run.bat gui
    ```

4. **Open**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Upgrading Models

By default, Genesis is configured for lightweight models (like Qwen 0.5B/1.5B) to ensure it runs on most hardware.

**Want more power?**
To enable better, larger, or different models:

1. Load this codebase into **Antigravity**.
2. Provide the specs of the new model you want (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, larger Qwen variants).
3. Tell Antigravity to add it.

It's that simple. The system is designed to be evolved *by* AI.

## User & Admin System

Genesis features a secure **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system.

- **Users**: Private managed chat, personal memory, and personal plugins.
- **Admins**: Full control over system settings, global history, prompts, and user accounts.

For full details on managing users and permissions, see the **[User Management Guide](docs/user_management.md)**.
